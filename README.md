# processmaker/vue-form-elements
Reusable VueJS form elements that renders with Bootstrap 4

## Summary
This is a collection of simple and rich form elements that can be bound to a parent VueJS component 
utilizing v-model.  If you are using Bootstrap 4, then the rendering of these elements will be easy to 
use and fit right into your html rendering.

## Preview
If you want to preview the elements in action, clone the github repository and run the npm run serve target. 
The vue-cli project will launch locally and you'll be able to play with each of the form elements.
